In this paper I would try my best to defend traditional marriage (monogamous) and hierarchical structures.

## Defining Terminologies used

I would first define the words that are about to be abundantly used in this paper, to reduce the abuse of notation.

**Power (P)** - Power here is defined as the ability to bring forth change either extrinsic (in the outer world) or intrinsic (inside yourself). The magnitude of power is subjective and depends upon the importance of the change brought forth. 

**Value (V)** - Value here is defined as the ability to bring forth power or in other words, value is potential power. Value is brought forth by a subject. Social Status is value so is physical strength

**Subject (S)** - Subject is any living/ non-living object that is potentially valuable. A person is a subject as is a gun or a piece of iron. The value possessed by a subject for a certain owner may or may not be constant.

**Owner (O)** - Owner here is someone who uses the subject and it’s value for increasing his power (ability to bring change). He may or may not necessarily own the subject. Also two people may mutually be each other’s owners in the sense that they bring value and increase the power of the other.

## A basic model of Owner and Subjects

Keeping in mind that the sole requirement for change in power is value (If there is any other requirement for change in power it can be classified as some kind of value itself). There can be a few models of how the number and other properties of a set of subjects impacts the effective value attained by the owner. 

The most basic model which would be somewhat reasonable is this → 

$$V_{eff} = \sum_{i=1}^{i=n} V(S_i)$$

Which means that the effective value exerted by all of the subjects will be equal to the sum of the individual values attained by them.

This however doesn’t tell us about the value of the individual subject. Is it constant? Does it depend on the number of subjects the owner has? 

Despite this above nuance here it is the most reasonable of all the general cases and relations of subjects and owners. If the owner owns a fan and two light bulbs the value he has would be the sum of the two light bulbs and a fan.

## Variable of time

In the previous example of two light bulbs and a fan. If we constrict the owner to a room where only one of the devices can be turned on at one time then he wouldn’t be able to enjoy the pleasure of all the devices he has and then the value exerted by all the devices would reduce. While turning on just one of the fans he gets an extra effective value of just one of the fans. 

Also, the amount of Subjects that you can have at your disposal at a given amount of time would certainly not be equal to the number of total subjects you have. As a result the effective value would only be the result of the amount of subjects you are using at some time t. 

Which would make the general equation the following 

$$V_{eff}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} V(S_i \ ,  \ t)$$

This however tells us only the effective value at time t. The total value acquired over the duration of time t will be the the following.

$$V_{total} = \sum_i^n \int  V(S_i \ ,  \ t_i) \ dt $$

This means that you gain more value from the same object as time increases or *the more time you spend using an object the more value it provides.* Except **if the object itself has some negative dependence of time in it’s value, i.e the value of the object changes negatively with time.

## Different possible models for life partners

So far I have shown that even if the value of an object doesn’t change with time using it for longer periods of time gives the owner a good value. 

Now I shall apply this model to life partners. If there are n people living together, there are n owners and n subjects in the sense that everybody benefits from the others and everybody in some shape or form benefits others (even if he negatively impacts others he still has a value, a negative value).

We will take a scenario where 1 person has n life partners, and try to see all possible scenarios of how the value  they offer is related to time, number of life partners and other variables; one among which I will try to prove the most reasonable and practically observable.

In general there can be 4 cases of difference

1. Value of a spouse can increase with increase in n and increase with increase in t
2. Value of a spouse can decrease with increase in n and increase with increase in t
3. Value of a spouse can increase with increase in  n and decrease with increase in t
4. Value of a spouse can decrease with increase in n and decrease with increase in t

Out of which I will argue that 2 is the more practically observed and reasonable of all the models.

### Arguments for monogamy

I will base my arguments upon these two claims.

1. Generally the more time you spend with someone the more your relations grow in intimacy
2. Emotional connection and intimacy (of all sorts) is more valuable than sex

I make the first claim not for all people because there are people of some sort that will manage to ruin their relationship and condescend anyone if they talk to them more than a week (we generally call them cunts). However for the major part of the demographic it is only natural that your relationship will grow more mature and intimate the more time you spend with somebody.

This follows from a broader assumption that people love people that they spend time with. An example of that would be a school friend. Most of the times it is someone who we know and talk to more than anyone else and as a result, understand them more than the rest of the people. As a result they become more valuable to us then other regular people.

The second claim however, I will say is very very subjective, if we take into regard the traditional definition of value but the way that I define value here this statement is not subjective. It must be objectively right or wrong. Either emotional connection and intimacy provides you more potential power than mere sexual relations or it is the other way around.

Throughout history sexual relations in some cases have been beneficial for founding kingdoms and alliances but that is not the case with the plebeian majority. An acceptable emotional connection with someone can help you do things with their resources and use their valuable subjects for your own benefit.

This may sound malicious but it is quite common in married livelihoods. People use their partner’s money, cars among other resources. If you get stuck in a traffic jam and a few goons show up to beat you, you can call your friend who is bit of a gangster himself. But he won’t show up for you if there is lack of an emotional connection between you two.

Emotional connections are therefore are very valuable considering the fact that you can manipulate or in less brutal terms, seek help from your subject.  

### A model following from the claims

The first claim would result in the following 

$$E \propto T \implies E =kT $$

*E here stands for intensity of emotional connections*

Although this may not be the case and emotional connections may grow quadratrically, exponentially or logarithmically with time but the above equation is a good general approximation (without being pedantic with the details).

The second claim would result in the following

$$V(S, t) = aE + bX $$

Where,  *X stands for intensity of sexual relations 
and a and b are two constants such that $a >> b$*

Using both of the above equations we get

$$V(S, t) = ak T + bX \approx ak T \approx c T \newline c=ak $$

Here, we are neglecting bX because b is very less.

This is value attained by a life partner at time t. Here, T stands for the amount of time that has been spent already with the respective life partner.

Putting this value in the equation 1.1.2 we get this

$$V_{total} = \int c_1 t \ dt + \int c_2 t \ dt \ ... \  n \  times $$

And when we integrate keeping $c_i$ constant we get

$$V_{total} = \frac{c_1}{2}t_1^2 + \frac{c_2}{2}t_2^2 ... \ n \ times+ C $$

Let’s say that all values of the constant $c_i$ are equal and let’s also assume that the time spent with all the life partners is equal. If that is the case then we replace $t_1, \ t_2$ with $\frac{T}{n}$. Where T is the total time spent with all the life partners.

With this simple addition our result becomes

$$V_{total} = \frac{c T^2}{2n^2} + \frac{c T^2}{2n^2} + \frac{c T^2}{2n^2} ... \ n \ times $$

$$V_{total} = \frac{cT^2}{2n^2} \times n = \frac{c T^2}{n}$$

As we can see from the above equation that the total value decreases linearly with increasing n, and increases quadratrically with an increasing T.

Which means that the value you get from your life partners decreases with the number of life partners you have and increases with the amount of time you spend on them. Provided the fact that 

1. The more time you spend with someone the more your relations grow in intimacy
2. Emotional connection and intimacy (of all sorts) is more valuable than sex

These axioms and the results that they show lead to the following conclusion.

**Value of a spouse can decrease with increase in n and increase with increase in t.**

and hence make a great case for marriage.

## A broader case for hierarchies

The case that I have made for life partners and monogamous marriage is just one single case out of a much broader general case.

The broader general case is that the above equations and conclusions apply to any valuable subject as long as it’s value increases with time and more subjects can’t be concurrently used.

This case however doesn’t apply to the example of fans and bulbs that I used earlier. You can use fans and bulbs at the same time and their value doesn’t increase with time it does on the other hand decrease with time due to wear, tear and maintenance. The more the merrier in this case.

This phenomena is causal for the existence of hierarchies in nature. To formally describe an hierarchy (for the sake of semantics) I would say -: An hierarchy is the will-full neglect of certain subjects for the sake of other subjects. The neglect can be in the form of neglect of time, neglect of condition of attention, etc etc.

If for example there exists a couple with 4 kids which they birthed and 10 kids in the neighbourhood, it would spend less time and attention on the kids in the neighbourhood for the sake of their own kids because they gain more value.

It should be noted that this doesn’t provide any arguments for the ethical questions raised on hierarchies. One such would be that “should someone with 4 kids adopt orphans?”. 

This model only proves the existence of hierarchies as intuitive and more valuable for an individual owner. In other words hierarchies make the owner more powerful.
