Scenius as opposed to genius is a theoretical model proposed by the musician [Brian Eno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno). It is opposed to the term "genius" both of which try to show the emergence of a work of art.

The "genius" model postulates that the emergence of a work of art is a one man process. A process in which one man toils and works hard to perfect his up and coming masterwork, this process is usually done in confinement, without societal intervention or feedback. The work of genius is the work of a singular man who undergoes pain and effort to perfect his skill and provide for us what is to be a masterwork.

The "scenius" model postulates that the emergence of a work of art is not a one man process but the process of many men who review, patronise, commend, criticise the artist which leads to the creation of a masterful piece of art. This mastery is not the result of high cognitive abilities or unparralleled talent. It is instead the result of the small contributions of many people, a whole community which becomes the haven of art.

Both of these models sound convincing on their own and also possible. A work of art can be the masterful thinking of an intellectual or the sum contributions of a community which is interested in art. We see historical and somewhat romanticized accounts of both of these models. We see Ludwig Van Beethoven, who is said to not eat for days at end to come up with his masterworks while we also see figures like Franz Liszt who was influenced heavily by many of his teachers, other composers, landscapes, like competition and etc etc.

While it is true that Beethoven himself if left secluded from the rest of the world wouldn't produce the same level of music as he has. It nevertheless is true that his social seclusion to some degree did help him come up with better work than he would have.

Also, in the past it wasn't so easy to find a community of like minded peers who wanted to contribute to or had something to contribute to your work. That's another possible reason that we find a lot of geniuses in the past. It may have had to do with the uniqueness and relative complexity of their work.

However it isn't the case now. You can find various communities that you can contribute to or ask to contribute to your work thus producing a gestalt, something which is bigger then the sum of it's constituents.

It can be said with no doubt that this is the most favourable age out of all those ages for producing any kind of art due to the ability to be closer to motivated peers. There are so many people who are doing the same things that you are doing or are willing to do the same things that you are willing to do.

The scenius model of creativity thus holds more importance and worth in our age, and that is why this place was built. To be a conscious scenius, a haven, a breeding ground for works of art.
